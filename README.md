    <h1> How do BananaByte Software Engineers' salaries and performance differ from other companies? </h1>
        <p> This is a Postgresql project that seeks to answer this question using both BananaByte Employees Average Salaries and Performance and those of Glassdoor. </p>
    <b> <p> Inquiry:</b> Have you ever wondered if salaries vary widely based on performance rates? We know there is no standard performance rate, but could there be an average performance rate that correlates with salary in the software engineering world? </p> 
    <b> <p> Tools & Methods:</b> Postgresql Group By, Window Functions and CTEs & a Google Slides Final Report </p>
    <b> <p> Analysis:</b> 
                <li> In the "Software Development Department" at BananaByte we want to look at average salaries of the following roles: Software Architect, Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer and Mobile Application Developer. </li>
                <li> Then, we want to rank each employee in each role by average salary and average performance scores. </li>
                <li> The next step is to look at average salaries and average performance scores of Glassdoor Software Engineers with the same titles </li> 
                <li> One caveat of note is naming conventions, the name "Software Architect" does not exist in the Glassdoor data, but rather it is more specific such as Senior IOS Architect and Android Architect. In SQL we have to group these roles together, so this grouping affects how we describe our results. </li>
